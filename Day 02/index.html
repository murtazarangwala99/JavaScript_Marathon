    <h1>Assignment For Day 2üòäü•áüåø</h1>
    <h2>1. What is lexical structure?</h2>
    <h3>
      <li>
        A programming language‚Äôs lexical structure specifies a set of some basic
        rules about how code should be written in it. Rules like what variable
        names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one
        program statement is separated from the next.
      </li>
    </h3>

    <h2>2. What is Unicode?</h2>
    <h3>
      <li>
        Unicode is an industry standard for consistent encoding of written text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Its aim is to provide a unique number to identify every character for
        every language, on any platform.
      </li>

    <h2>
      3. Explain all the keywords present in the JavaScript with examples.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <li>Answer in the keyword.js File</li>
    </h3>

    <h2>4. What are shorthand operators, explain with a suitable example?</h2>
    <h3>
      <li>
        A shorthand operator is a shorter way to express something that is
        already available in the programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example:
        <p>let i = 0;</p>
        <p>i = i + 2; // Normal Way</p>
        <p>i += 2; // Shorthand Way</p>
      </li>
    </h3>

    <h2>5. What is ‚Äúuse Strict‚Äù in JavaScript?</h2>
    <h3>
      <li>
        JavaScript's strict mode, is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of
        JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw
          errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to
          perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run
          faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of
          ECMAScript.
        </li>
      </ol>
